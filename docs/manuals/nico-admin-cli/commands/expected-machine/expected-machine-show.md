## NAME

nico-admin-cli-expected-machine-show - Show expected machine data

## SYNOPSIS

```text
nico-admin-cli expected-machine show [--id] [--extended]
[--sort-by] [-h|--help] [BMC_MAC_ADDRESS]
```

## DESCRIPTION

Show expected machine data

## OPTIONS

`--id <ID>`

ID (UUID) of the expected machine to show. Cannot be combined with a BMC
MAC address.

`--extended`

Extended result output.

This is used by measured boot, where basic output contains just what you
probably care about, and "extended" output also dumps out all the
internal UUIDs that are used to associate instances.

`--sort-by <SORT_BY> [default: primary-id]`

Sort output by specified field

*Possible values:*

> - primary-id: Sort by the primary ID
>
> - state: Sort by state

`-h, --help`

Print help (see a summary with -h)

[*BMC_MAC_ADDRESS*]

BMC MAC address of the expected machine to show. Omit both this address
and --id to list all expected machines.

## Examples

```sh
nico-admin-cli expected-machine show
nico-admin-cli expected-machine show 00:11:22:33:44:55
nico-admin-cli expected-machine show --id 12345678-1234-5678-90ab-cdef01234567
```
