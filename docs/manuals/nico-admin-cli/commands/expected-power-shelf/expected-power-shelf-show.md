## NAME

nico-admin-cli-expected-power-shelf-show - Show expected power shelf

## SYNOPSIS

```text
nico-admin-cli expected-power-shelf show [--id]

```

## DESCRIPTION

Show expected power shelf

## OPTIONS

`--id <ID>`

ID (UUID) of the expected power shelf to show. Cannot be combined with a
BMC MAC address.

`--extended`

Extended result output.

This is used by measured boot, where basic output contains just what you
probably care about, and "extended" output also dumps out all the
internal UUIDs that are used to associate instances.

`--sort-by <SORT_BY> [default: primary-id]`

Sort output by specified field

*Possible values:*

> - primary-id: Sort by the primary ID
>
> - state: Sort by state

`-h, --help`

Print help (see a summary with -h)

[*BMC_MAC_ADDRESS*]

BMC MAC address of the expected power shelf to show. Omit both this
address and --id to list all expected power shelves.

## Examples

```sh
nico-admin-cli expected-power-shelf show
nico-admin-cli expected-power-shelf show 00:11:22:33:44:55
nico-admin-cli expected-power-shelf show --id 12345678-1234-5678-90ab-cdef01234567
