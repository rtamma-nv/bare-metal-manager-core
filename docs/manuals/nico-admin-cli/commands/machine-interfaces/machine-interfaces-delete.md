## NAME

nico-admin-cli-machine-interfaces-delete - Delete Machine interface.

## SYNOPSIS

```text
nico-admin-cli machine-interfaces delete [--mac-address]
[--extended] [--sort-by] [-h|--help]
[INTERFACE_ID]
```

## DESCRIPTION

Delete a machine interface.

Exactly one deletion selector must be specified: INTERFACE_ID or
--mac-address. Providing both selectors is rejected.

## OPTIONS

`--mac-address <MAC_ADDRESS>`

Delete every interface carrying this MAC address instead of selecting by
ID.

`--extended`

Extended result output.

This is used by measured boot, where basic output contains just what you
probably care about, and "extended" output also dumps out all the
internal UUIDs that are used to associate instances.

`--sort-by <SORT_BY> [default: primary-id]`

Sort output by specified field

*Possible values:*

> - primary-id: Sort by the primary ID
>
> - state: Sort by state

`-h, --help`

Print help (see a summary with -h)

[*INTERFACE_ID*]

The interface ID to delete.

## Examples

```sh
nico-admin-cli machine-interfaces delete 12345678-1234-5678-90ab-cdef01234567
nico-admin-cli machine-interfaces delete --mac-address 00:11:22:33:44:55
```
