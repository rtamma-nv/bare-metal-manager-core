# SKU Validation

NVIDIA Infra Controller (NICo) supports checking and validating the hardware in a machine, known as "SKU Validation."

## Summary

A SKU is a collection of definitions managed by NICo that define a specific configuration of machine.
Each host managed by NICo must have a SKU associated with it before it can be made available for use by a tenant.

{/* TODO: did we actually implement this? */}

Hardware configurations or SKUs are generated from existing machines by an admin and uploaded to NICo via the CLI.
SKUs can be downloaded for modification or use with other sites.

Machines that are assigned a SKU are automatically validated during ingestion based on their discovery information.
Hardware validation occurs during initial ingestion and after an instance is released and new discovery information is received.

New machines are automatically checked against existing SKUs and if a match is found, the machine passes
SKU validation and continues with the normal ingestion process. If no match is found the machine waits until
a matching SKU is available or until the machine is made compatible with an existing SKU, if SKU validation is enabled
in the site (`ignore_unassigned_machines` configuration option).

## Behavior

SKU Validation can be enabled or disabled for a site, however, when it is enabled, it may or may not
apply to a given machine. For a machine to have SKU Validation enforced, it must have an assigned SKU,
however, note that SKUs will automatically be assigned to machines that match a given SKU, if they are in ready state.

If a machine has an assigned SKU, and NICo (when the machine changes state and is not assigned) detects that
the hardware configuration does not match, the machine will have a SKU mismatch health alert placed on it, and it
will be prevented from having allocations assigned to it.

Generally, SKUs must be manually added a site to configure its SKUs. At some point, we may do this during the site
bring-up process. However, for now, SKUs are only manually added to sites. It is also expected that, generally,
the SKU assignments for individual machines are added automatically by NICo as those machines are reconfigured.

An admin can also assign or remove a SKU on an individual host manually, either with the `nico-admin-cli sku assign` /
`nico-admin-cli sku unassign` commands or from the machine detail page of the [NICo Debug WebUI](../operations/debug_webui.md).

### BOM Validation States

Verifying a SKU against a machine goes through several steps to acquire updated machine inventory and perform the validation. Depending on the inventory of the machine and the SKU configuration, the state machine needs to handle several situations. The bom validation process is broken down into the following sub-states:

- `MatchingSku` - The state machine will attempt to find an existing SKU that matches the machine inventory.
- `UpdatingInventory` - NICo is requesting that scout re-inventory the machine. This ensures that other operations are using a recent version of the machine inventory
- `VerifyingSku` - NICo is comparing the machine inventory against the SKU
- `SkuVerificationFailed` - The machine did not match the SKU. Manual intervention is required. The `sku verify` command may be used to retry the verification
- `WaitingForSkuAssignment` - The machine does not have a SKU assigned and the configuration requires one.
- `SkuMissing` - The machine has a SKU assigned, but the SKU does not exist. This happens when a SKU is specified in the expected machines, but was not created. If configured, NICo will attempt to generate a SKU

### Versions

NICo maintains a version of the SKU schema used when a SKU is created. This ensures that the same comparison is used during the lifetime of a SKU and ensures that the behavior of BOM validation does not change between NICo versions. When new components are added, or new data sources are used during validation, existing SKUs will not be updated with the change and continue to behave as they did in previous NICo versions. In order to use the new version, a new SKU must be created. The one exception is the storage location format described in [Storage Drive Locations](#storage-drive-locations): schema version 5 SKUs that still record a controller name must be updated in place.

### Configuration

SKU validation is enabled or disabled for an entire site at once, using the NICo configuration file.
The block that defines it is called `bom_validation`:

```toml
[bom_validation]
enabled = false
ignore_unassigned_machines = false
allow_allocation_on_validation_failure = false
find_match_interval = "300s"
auto_generate_missing_sku = false,
auto_generate_missing_sku_interval = "300s"
```

- `enabled` - Enables or disables the entire bom validation process. When disabled, machines
  will skip bom validation and proceed as if all validation has passed.
- `allow_allocation_on_validation_failure` - When true, machines with an assigned SKU are allowed to stay in Ready state
  and remain allocatable even when SKU validation fails. Validation still occurs but only logs are recorded - health reports
  are cleared instead of recording validation failures. Machines do not transition into failed states
  (SkuVerificationFailed or SkuMissing). When false (default), standard mode applies where validation failures are recorded
  in health reports and machines enter failed states and become unallocatable until fixed. This is useful for avoiding machine
  allocation blockage due to SKU validation issues when you only need logging without health report alerts. This option does
  not bypass a machine without an assigned SKU; with `ignore_unassigned_machines = false`, that machine waits for SKU
  assignment.
- `ignore_unassigned_machines` - When true and BOM validation encounters a machine that does not have an associated SKU,
  it will proceed as if all validation has passed. Only machines with an associated SKU will be validated. This allows
  existing sites to be upgraded and BOM Validation enabled as SKUs are added to the system without impacting site operation.
  Machines that do not have an assigned SKU will still be usable and assignable.
- `find_match_interval` - determines how often NICo will attempt to find a matching SKU for a machine. NICo will only
  attempt to find a SKU when the machine is in the `Ready` state.
- `auto_generate_missing_sku` - Enables or disables generation of a SKU from a machine. This only applies to a machine with a SKU
specified in the expected machine configuration and in the `SkuMissing` state.
- `auto_generate_missing_sku_interval` - Determines how often NICo will attempt to generate a SKU from the machine data.

### Hardware Validated

<Tip>
This list is current as of NICo v2.1. More hardware validation may be added in the future.
</Tip>

NICo validates the following hardware against the SKU:

- Chassis (motherboard): Vendor and model matched
- CPU: Model and count matched
- GPUs: Model, memory capacity, and count matched
- Memory: Type, capacity, and count matched
- Storage: Capacity and PCI location of each NVMe drive matched for schema version 5 and later. Versions 1 through 4 matched model and count, and version 0 did not validate storage. For more information, refer to [Storage Drive Locations](#storage-drive-locations).

### Storage Drive Locations

Schema version 5 SKUs record one storage entry per NVMe drive. Each entry includes the drive capacity as a size range and its physical location in `pci_patterns`. When NICo generates a SKU from a machine, `min_size_mb` and `max_size_mb` are equal. The model is for reference only and is not compared.

In an expected SKU, you can omit either bound to define an open range; `sku show` displays an omitted bound as `*` and leaves the size cell blank when both are omitted. Both bounds are inclusive values in MiB, and `min_size_mb` must not exceed `max_size_mb`. You can omit `pci_patterns` to match drives by size alone. Each entry must include at least one size bound or one PCI pattern. NICo rejects invalid regular expressions, and a minimum bound above the maximum, when you create or replace the SKU.

The recorded location is the NVMe controller's sysfs device path with its last node removed, for example `/devices/pci0000:64/0000:64:02.0/0000:65:00.0/nvme`. The removed node is the kernel's controller name (`nvme3`), which is assigned in probe order and can change between boots or differ between identical machines. The remaining path is fixed by the PCI slot, so identical machines produce identical entries.

Each pattern is a regular expression matched anywhere in the recorded location. A generated SKU holds the literal path; an expected SKU may keep it or widen it:

```text
/devices/pci0000:64/0000:64:02.0/0000:65:00.0/nvme   the generated literal path
0000:65:00\.0/nvme                                   this slot under any PCI root
^/devices/pci.*/nvme$                                any NVMe drive; set count to the number of drives
```

Each entry in an expected SKU is a group. `count` is the number of drives the group claims, and a drive is eligible for the group when it matches any of the group's `pci_patterns`. Every pattern in a group must match at least one drive, or validation reports `Expected storage drive at PCI location /.../ not found`. A generated SKU lists one entry per drive with `count` set to 1. An expected SKU can merge drives into one group by listing several patterns or by using a broader pattern with a higher count.

A literal path works as a pattern because each `.` can match a literal dot, although it also matches any other character. To match the complete recorded location exactly, escape each dot as `\.` and enclose the pattern with `^` and `$`. In the JSON file, write the backslash twice (`\\.`) so that the pattern reaches the regular expression as `\.`. Do not end a pattern with a controller name such as `nvme0$`. The recorded location never contains it, so such a pattern matches nothing.

`sku show` and `sku generate` render the entries with their size range and patterns:

```

#### Updating SKUs That Still End in a Controller Name

Schema version 5 SKUs generated before [issue #6013](https://github.com/dsx-ai-factory/infra-controller/issues/6013) was fixed stored the full controller path, for example `/devices/pci0000:64/0000:64:02.0/0000:65:00.0/nvme/nvme3`. That pattern is longer than the location NICo now records, so it matches nothing: machines assigned the SKU fail verification with `Expected storage drive at PCI location /.../ not found` and `Found unexpected storage drive (...)` for every drive, and unassigned machines are not matched to the SKU. Update each pattern so that it ends at `/nvme`, then replace the SKU:

```sh
nico-admin-cli -f json -o <sku_name>.json sku show <sku_name>
# In <sku_name>.json, shorten each "pci_patterns" entry to end in "/nvme" by removing the
# controller name ("nvme<N>") and anything after it.
nico-admin-cli sku replace <sku_name>.json
```

If `sku replace` fails with `Specified SKU matches SKU with ID: <other_sku>`, the two SKUs describe the same hardware: the controller name made identical machines generate separate SKUs. Keep one and retire the other after upgrading NICo, when the unshortened SKU no longer matches any inventory and automatic matching cannot reattach it. For each machine that `sku show-machines <redundant_sku>` lists, run `sku unassign <machineid>` and then `sku assign <kept_sku> <machineid>`. `sku unassign` requires the machine to be in the `Ready` or `SkuVerificationFailed` state, and `sku assign` accepts those states plus `WaitingForSkuAssignment` and `SkuMissing`; in any other state, such as an allocated machine, pass `--force` to both commands. Without `--force`, `sku assign` also refuses a machine that still has a SKU. Finally, remove the redundant SKU with `sku delete <redundant_sku>`.

The shortened pattern is a prefix of the old path, so it also matches inventory recorded by earlier releases, and you can update the SKU before or after upgrading NICo. A pattern that ends with the `$` anchor is the exception: it matches only the new location, so remove the anchor until the upgrade is complete.

You can also regenerate the SKU from a machine with `sku generate <machineid> --id <sku_name>` and replace it. For an example, refer to [Upgrading a SKU to the Current Version Example](#upgrading-a-sku-to-the-current-version-example). Regeneration requires a machine whose inventory was collected by a release that records drive sizes and locations. If the stored inventory predates those fields, `sku generate` emits storage entries without constraints. In that case, `sku replace` rejects the file until the machine has been re-inventoried.

## SKU Names

By convention, SKU names (defined per site) are in the following format:

`<vendor>.<model>.<node_type>.<idx>`

Where:

- `<vendor>` is the first word of the "chassis" "vendor" field, e.g. `dell` or `lenovo`
- `<model>` is the unique ending to the "chassis" "model" field, e.g. `r750` or `sr670v2`
- `<node_type>` is one of the following types of node that are deployed in NICo:
  - `gpu`
  - `cpu`
  - `storage`
  - `controller` (site controller node, if applicable)
- `<idx>` arbitrary index starting at 1 to define different configurations, if required, generally 1

Some example SKU names:

- `lenovo.sr670v2.gpu.1`
- `dell.r750.gpu.1`
- `dell.r750.storage.1`

## Managing SKU Validation

### Browse SKUs, their configuration, and assigned machines

You can view all the SKUs for a site, and click into their specific configurations and list assigned machines
by visiting the admin page for a site and clicking "SKUs" from the left-side navigation bar.

### Viewing SKU information

There are 2 commands for showing information related to SKUs:

- `sku show` lists SKUs or shows information related to an existing SKU.
- `sku generate` shows what a SKU would look like for a machine. The generate command does not create the SKU or assign the SKU to the machine.

Both commands honor the JSON format flag `-f json` to change the output to JSON. JSON is used by other commands.

The `sku show` command can be used to list all SKUs, or show the details of a single SKU:

```sh
nico-admin-cli sku show [<sku id>]

> nico-admin-cli sku show

### Creating SKUs for a Site

To create a SKU, the easiest method is generally taking the configuration of an example, known good machine
(this can be verified during creation) and applying that to the site.

Using information from the viewed SKU information above (vendor, model, and node type), you should be able to
create the `sku_name`, and using the example machine, then create the SKU config and upload it to the
site controller.

Save the SKU information (on your local machine, written to an output file):

```sh
nico-admin-cli -f json -o <sku_name>.json sku generate <machineid> --id <sku_name>
```

This will create a file in the current directory with the name `<sku_name>.json`, at this point you can create the
SKU on the site controller:

```sh
nico-admin-cli sku create <sku_name>.json
```

### Assign a SKU to a machine

Note that generally, you do not need to assign a SKU to a machine, since the SKU is automatically assigned when the
machine goes to ready (not assigned) state, or goes through a machine validation workflow.

```sh
nico-admin-cli sku assign <sku_name> <machineid>
```

### Remove a SKU assignment from a machine

To remove the assignment of a SKU from a machine, the `sku unassign` can be used. Note that if a machine already matches
a SKU in the given site, and it is not in an assigned state, it will likely be quickly reassigned automatically by
the site controller after this command is run. Matching uses the machine's current inventory, so a SKU whose storage
patterns still end in a controller name is not matched until it is updated as described in
[Storage Drive Locations](#storage-drive-locations).

```sh
nico-admin-cli sku unassign <machineid>
```

### Replacing an existing SKU

If a SKU has a set of components that do not work for a set of machines (either due to bugs, or NICo software updates) updating machines by unassigning and assigning a SKU would be challenging. Replacing the components of a SKU can be done with the `sku replace` command. This will force all machines to go through verification when no instance is allocated to the machine (all machines are verified when an instance is released).

```sh
nico-admin-cli sku replace <filename> [--id <sku_name>]
```

### Remove a SKU from a site

To remove a SKU from a site, you must first remove all machines that have been assigned that SKU manually, you may want
to run the `sku unassign` command above in a shell loop to remove all the machines quickly. Note that you can query which
machines have a given SKU using the command below, `sku show-machines` then follow it with the
following command to remove the SKU:

```sh
nico-admin-cli sku delete <sku_name>
```

#### Upgrading a SKU to the current version example

When a new version of NICo is released that changes how SKUs behave, existing SKUs maintain their previous behavior. In order to use the new version of the SKU, a manual "upgrade" process is required using the `sku replace` command. The output in this example was captured with an older release. Newer releases also show the `Size (MiB)` and `PCI Patterns` storage columns described in [Storage Drive Locations](#storage-drive-locations).

The existing SKU is below. Note that the "Storage Devices" section includes a device with a model of "NO_MODEL" and there is no TPM. The extra storage device is created by the raid card and may not always exist and should not have been included in the SKU.

```sh

```

Using the `sku generate` command, we can see what the updated SKU looks like for the same machine. This is the same machine that generated the older SKU in a previous release. Note that the "NO_MODEL" device is gone, the RAID controller is now shown as `Dell BOSS-N1` and the version of the TPM is shown.

Create a new SKU file using the generate command again, but create a json file. Note that the same ID needs to be specified as the existing SKU in order for the replace command to find the old SKU.

```sh
nico-admin-cli -f json -o /tmp/xe9680.json sku g fm100hti7olik00gefc9qlma831n6q49d1odkksp86q639cugt5afjnm4s0 --id XE9680

```

Then replace the old SKU

```sh
nico-admin-cli sku replace /tmp/xe9680.json
+--------+---------------------------------------+------------------+-----------------------------+

```

The `sku show` command now shows the updated components (and version)

```sh
nico-admin-cli sku show XE9680

### Finding assigned machines for a SKU

To find all the assigned machines for a given SKU:

```sh
nico-admin-cli sku show-machines <sku_name>
```

### Force SKU revalidation

It may be beneficial when diagnosing a machine to force NICo to revalidate a SKU on a machine, if the machine is suspected
of issues, or if you believe that the validation may be out of date. You can force a revalidation with the command below,
it will be validated the next time the machine is unassigned. Note that you cannot validate an assigned machine, and NICo
will refrain from doing so automatically.

```sh
nico-admin-cli sku verify <sku_name>
```

## Issues

### What to do if a machine is failing validation

For a given machine, if it has already been assigned a SKU manually or automatically, it likely
was correct at some point, and the effort of the investigation should be to determine what has
changed on the machine to cause it to now fail validation.

For example, the machine may have gone through maintenance and is now missing one of its GPUs or
storage drives. The health alert generated by failing the validation should provide some context
as to where the mismatch is believed to be. Using this, it should be possible to diagnose if the
machine is actually configured incorrectly, or in the case that the new configuration should be
correct, you can remove the SKU from the machine `sku unassign` and create a new SKU as shown
above to represent this machine.

A mismatch that reports `Expected storage drive at PCI location /.../ not found` together with
`Found unexpected storage drive (...)` for the same number of drives usually means the SKU's storage patterns still
end in a controller name. Update the SKU as described in [Storage Drive Locations](#storage-drive-locations) instead of
unassigning the machine.
