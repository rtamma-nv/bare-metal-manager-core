# RMS Configuration (Day 1) <Badge intent="info">v2.0</Badge>

Reference for the `nico-api` site-configuration settings that connect NICo to the
**[Rack Management Service (RMS)](https://docs.nvidia.com/rms/documentation/home/)** and
select it as the backend for rack hardware operations.

Settings are grouped by the component that consumes them. For how the integration fits
together, refer to [RMS Backend](../architecture/backends/rms.md). For the upstream Flow
service's implementation selection, refer to
[Flow Component Managers](flow-component-manager.md).

## Overview

Four configuration sections take part in the integration, and each is owned by a different
NICo component:

| Section | Component | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `[rms]` | RMS client | Where RMS is and how to authenticate to it |
| `[component_manager]` | Component Manager | Which backend handles each hardware role |
| `[rack_profiles]` | Rack state machine and Component Manager | Node descriptors and the firmware manifest source |
| `[switch_state_controller]` | Switch state controller | Which switch services receive mTLS certificates |

NICo reads these from the site config file mounted into the `nico-api` pod. In Helm-based
deployments the file is rendered from chart values, so the settings on this page are the
TOML that those values produce.

Canonical field reference for all NICo settings:
[`crates/api-core/src/cfg/README.md`](https://github.com/dsx-ai-factory/infra-controller/blob/main/crates/api-core/src/cfg/README.md).

---

## `[rms]` — RMS Client Connection

Controls whether NICo builds an RMS client, and the mutual TLS material it presents.

### `api_url`

The RMS gRPC endpoint.

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Type | String |
| Required | Yes, to enable any RMS-backed workflow |
| Default | None |

When this field is unset or empty, NICo does not construct an RMS client. NICo Core still
starts, but `build_component_manager` fails if any backend selects `rms`. The Component
Manager remains uninitialized, and its RPCs return configuration errors. Select non-RMS
backends for all three roles when RMS is disabled.

The NICo chart renders `https://rms-api-server.rack-manager.svc.cluster.local:8801`, which
matches the `rack-manager` chart's Service in its default namespace.

### `enforce_tls`

Requests TLS enforcement on connections to RMS.

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Boolean |
| Required | No |
| Default | `true` |

Keep this enabled in production. The RMS client library can enforce it only when it finds both
a root CA and a complete client certificate and key pair. If either is unavailable, the
library warns that TLS enforcement is disabled and changes the effective value to `false`.
The resulting client can connect to an HTTP endpoint or use a dummy certificate verifier.
Treat that warning as a configuration error in production. Disable this setting only against
an RMS instance deliberately started in its insecure development mode.

### `root_ca_path`, `client_cert`, `client_key`

Paths inside the `nico-api` container to mutual TLS material for RMS.

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Type | String |
| Required | No |
| Default | None |

Leave all three unset in a standard deployment. The RMS client library then discovers
`nico-api`'s own SPIFFE certificate mount at `/var/run/secrets/spiffe.io/`, which shares a
certificate authority with the RMS API server certificate. That produces mutual TLS in both
directions with no extra mounts.

<Warning>
Supplying `client_cert` without `client_key` yields no client certificate **and** suppresses
the SPIFFE fallback. Set both fields or neither.
</Warning>

### `scale_up_fabric_manager_api_version`

Selects the RMS API used by the ScaleUpFabric Manager workflow.

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Type | String, one of `v1` or `v2` |
| Required | No |
| Default | `v2` |

`v1` is accepted for configuration compatibility and has no effect. Any other value fails
configuration load.

---

## `[component_manager]` — Backend Selection

Selects which backend handles each hardware role. **All three backend fields default to
`rms`**, so a deployment that enables RMS for one role must explicitly set the others to
non-RMS values.

| Field | Accepted values | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `compute_tray_backend` | `rms`, `core`, `mock` | `rms` |
| `nv_switch_backend` | `rms`, `nsm`, `mock` | `rms` |
| `power_shelf_backend` | `rms`, `psm`, `mock` | `rms` |

The `nsm` and `psm` values require externally managed services. The NICo deployment charts do
not install NSM or PSM.

### State Controller Routing

| Field | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `compute_tray_use_state_controller` | Boolean | `false` |
| `nv_switch_use_state_controller` | Boolean | `false` |
| `power_shelf_use_state_controller` | Boolean | `false` |

When `true`, power control and firmware update calls for that role route through the state
controller instead of dispatching directly to the device. Status reads and firmware-catalog
reads still pass through to the direct backend. The NICo chart sets all three to `true`.

---

## `[rack_profiles]` — Node Descriptors and Firmware Source

For RMS backends, NICo builds a node descriptor from the rack profile containing three
attributes:

- **Role** — derived from the operation as `compute`, `switch`, or `power_shelf`
- **Product family** — taken from `product_family`
- **Vendor** — taken from `rack_capabilities.<role>.vendor`, for each role using an RMS backend

NICo trims outer whitespace from product-family and vendor values and requires both to be
non-empty. Case and internal punctuation are preserved after trimming. NICo does not check
these values against a supported-hardware list; RMS validates each combination when it
receives a request and returns `INVALID_ARGUMENT` when no rule matches.

RMS normalizes both values before matching: comparison is case-insensitive and ignores spaces,
hyphens, and underscores, so `Lite-On`, `LiteOn`, and `lite_on` are equivalent. Normalized
values are compared in full rather than by prefix, so `NVIDIACorp` does not match `NVIDIA`.

<Note>
RMS resolves a fixed set of role, vendor, and product-family combinations, and that set
changes as platforms are added. Check the
[Hardware Compatibility List](https://docs.nvidia.com/rms/documentation/reference/hardware-compatibility-list)
as a compatibility reference. The list includes hardware under development, and inclusion
does not imply qualification, certification, or support. Confirm support for each combination
against the deployed RMS release rather than assuming a vendor is supported because NICo
accepted the string at startup.
</Note>

### Field Reference

| Field | Accepted values | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `product_family` | Non-empty string; RMS validates support at request time | When an RMS-backed operation uses the profile |
| `rack_hardware_topology` | `gb200_nvl36r1_c2g4_topology`, `gb200_nvl72r1_c2g4_topology`, `gb300_nvl36r1_c2g4_topology`, `gb300_nvl72r1_c2g4_topology`, `vr_nvl8r1_c2g4_rtf_topology`, `vr_nvl72r1_c2g4_topology` | No |
| `rack_capabilities.<role>.vendor` | Non-empty string; RMS validates support at request time | For each role whose backend is `rms` |
| `rack_capabilities.<role>.count` | Non-negative integer | Always, for all three roles |

`count` is independent of RMS. It tells the rack state machine how many devices of that role a
rack must have before it can progress. A rack stays in `Created` until all three roles have at
least `count` devices registered, and stays in `Discovering` until all three roles have at
least `count` devices in `Ready` state.

Each rack that uses an RMS-backed operation must have a `rack_profile_id` matching a key under
`[rack_profiles]`.

### `firmware_object` — Rack Firmware Manifest Source

Declares where NICo fetches the rack's standardized firmware manifest during rack ingestion
and maintenance.

| Field | Type | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `url` | URL | Yes, when the block is present | None |
| `fetch_timeout` | Duration string | No | `30s` |

When a profile omits the `firmware_object` block, rack ingestion skips the automatic firmware
update unless an explicit maintenance request supplies a firmware object. NICo fetches the
document, confirms it parses as a JSON object, and sends the body inline to RMS. The document
body is capped at 16 MiB.

```toml
[rack_profiles.NVL72.firmware_object]
url = "https://artifacts.example.internal/manifests/vr-nvl72-0.6-build14.json"
fetch_timeout = "60s"
```

---

## `[switch_state_controller]` — Switch mTLS Services

### `switch_mtls_services`

Selects which switch services receive the certificate NICo installs through RMS.

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Array of strings |
| Required | No |
| Default | All four services |

Accepted values, written in snake case:

| Value | Service |
| --- | --- |
| `nvue_api` | NVOS REST API (NVUE) |
| `scale_up_fabric_telemetry` | ScaleUpFabric telemetry collector (NMX-T) |
| `scale_up_fabric_manager` | ScaleUpFabric manager daemon (NMX-C) |
| `scale_up_fabric_telemetry_interface` | ScaleUpFabric telemetry interface (gNMI) |

Omitting the field **and** supplying an empty list both select all four services.

<Note>
`[rack_state_controller] nmx_cluster_switch_mtls_services` is deprecated. The setting is still
parsed so existing site configurations load, but rack maintenance does not configure switch
certificates and never reads it. Use `switch_mtls_services` instead.
</Note>

---

## Startup Validation

NICo validates rack profiles at startup **when any Component Manager backend is set to
`rms`**. Validation checks the product family and the vendor fields for the roles that use an
RMS backend.

| Condition | Outcome |
| --- | --- |
| No role uses the `rms` backend | Validation is skipped |
| `[rack_profiles]` is empty while any role uses `rms` | Rejected at startup |
| Missing `product_family` on a profile, with any RMS role | Rejected at startup |
| Missing vendor for a role whose backend is `rms` | Rejected at startup |
| Per-rack `rack_profile_id` missing or unknown | Surfaces at runtime, not startup |

Startup validation does not scan rack database rows, so per-rack profile assignment errors
appear when an RMS operation runs. When `deny_unknown_fields = false` (the default), unknown
keys in `[rms]` and `[component_manager]` produce warnings, are ignored, and configuration
loading continues. When `deny_unknown_fields = true`, unknown keys fail configuration loading.

```toml
[component_manager]
compute_tray_backend = "rms"

product_family = "gb200"
rack_hardware_topology = "gb200_nvl72r1_c2g4_topology"

[rack_profiles.NVL72.rack_capabilities.compute]
vendor = "NVIDIA"
count = 18

[rack_profiles.NVL72.rack_capabilities.switch]
vendor = "NVIDIA"
count = 9

[rack_profiles.NVL72.rack_capabilities.power_shelf]
vendor = "LiteOn"
count = 8
```

### GB300 Rack With NVIDIA Compute Trays and Delta Power Shelves

```toml

compute_tray_backend = "rms"
nv_switch_backend = "rms"
power_shelf_backend = "rms"

[rms]
api_url = "https://rms-api-server.rack-manager.svc.cluster.local:8801"

[rack_profiles.NVL72_GB300]
product_family = "gb300"
rack_hardware_topology = "gb300_nvl72r1_c2g4_topology"

[rack_profiles.NVL72_GB300.rack_capabilities.compute]
vendor = "NVIDIA"
count = 18

[rack_profiles.NVL72_GB300.rack_capabilities.switch]
vendor = "nvidia"
count = 9

[rack_profiles.NVL72_GB300.rack_capabilities.power_shelf]
vendor = "delta"
count = 6
```

## Machine Slot and Tray Enrichment

During machine ingestion, site-explorer uses `batch_get_node_device_info` only to enrich the
machine with RMS slot and tray data. It uses the rack profile to build a compute node
descriptor. This path runs when **both** conditions hold:

1. An RMS client is configured, meaning `[rms] api_url` is set.
2. The machine has a `rack_id`.

Under those conditions the profile must include compute `product_family` and `vendor` data.
Setting `compute_tray_backend` to a non-RMS value does not remove this requirement.

---

## RMS Server-Side Configuration

Settings on this page configure **NICo's side** of the integration. RMS has its own runtime
configuration in `/etc/rms/config.toml`, which the container reads at startup. It covers
listening ports, TLS material, switch certificate roots, the firmware directory, job
retention, and the database connection.

The RMS documentation is the source of truth for those settings:

- [Configuring RMS](https://docs.nvidia.com/rms/documentation/configuration/configuring-rms) — the complete TOML reference
- [Configuration via Helm](https://docs.nvidia.com/rms/documentation/configuration/configuration-via-helm) — how chart values render that file
- [Kubernetes Deployment with Helm](https://docs.nvidia.com/rms/documentation/deployment/kubernetes-deployment-with-helm) — deploying the `rack-manager` chart

Two RMS settings have to agree with the NICo values on this page:

| RMS setting | Must match |
| --- | --- |
| `port` | The port in `[rms] api_url` |
| `tls.ca` | A certificate authority that trusts NICo's client certificate |

The RMS API server certificate also has to carry a subject alternative name matching the DNS
name in `[rms] api_url`.
