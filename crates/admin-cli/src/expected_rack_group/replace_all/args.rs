EXAMPLES:

Replace all expected rack groups from a JSON file:
    $ nico-admin-cli expected-rack-group replace-all --filename ./rack-groups.json

File shape (an empty expected_rack_groups array clears all groups):
    {\"expected_rack_groups\":[{\"rack_group_id\":\"nvl5-gp1-jhb01\",\"topology\":\"gb200_nvl72r1_c2g4\",\"racks\":[]}]}

The optional expected_rack_groups_count must equal the array length.
metadata uses name, description, and labels as [{\"key\":\"location.datacenter\",\"value\":\"JHB01\"}].
