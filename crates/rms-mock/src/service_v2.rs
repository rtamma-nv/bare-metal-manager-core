//! `RackManagerV2` service implementation.
//!
//! V2 is a separate gRPC service with a single method. Note that V1 declares a
//! method of the same name taking different message types; keeping the two
//! impls in separate files makes it hard to reach for the wrong one. The V1
//! spelling stays unimplemented.
