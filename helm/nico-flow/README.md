# nico-flow Helm Chart

This chart deploys NICo Flow, the task, policy, and automation service, as a
standalone release in the `flow` namespace. `helm-prereqs/setup.sh` installs it
in phase 7h; it is disabled by default in the umbrella chart
(`nico-flow.enabled: false`).

## Runtime configuration (`flowConfig`)

Flow reads runtime settings from `/etc/flow/flowconfig.yaml`. The chart renders
that file from the `flowConfig` values into the `flow-config-files` ConfigMap
and mounts it read-only into the Flow container. The Deployment carries a
checksum of the rendered file, so changing any value rolls the Flow pod.

The defaults below equal the built-in defaults in
`rest-api/flow/internal/config/config.go`, so an unchanged block behaves the
same as running Flow without a config file.

| Value | File key | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `flowConfig.inventoryRunFrequency` | `inventory_run_frequency` | duration | `1m` | Interval between inventory synchronisation runs. Must be greater than zero. |
| `flowConfig.disableInventory` | `disable_inventory` | boolean | `false` | Skip the periodic inventory synchronisation job. |
| `flowConfig.leakDetectionInterval` | `leak_detection_interval` | duration | `1m` | Interval between leak detection runs. Must be greater than zero. |
| `flowConfig.disableLeakDetection` | `disable_leak_detection` | boolean | `false` | Skip the periodic leak detection job. |

The file format also accepts `grpc_timeout`, but Flow does not consume it, so
the chart does not expose it; a future chart version can add it once Flow does.

### Durations

Durations use the Go `time.ParseDuration` format: one or more unsigned decimal
numbers, each followed by a unit from `ns`, `us`, `µs`, `ms`, `s`, `m`, or `h`,
for example `30s`, `1m`, `1.5h`, or `1h30m`. A leading sign is not accepted.
Both intervals must be greater than zero.

The chart's render-time check is syntactic: it rejects values that do not match
this shape and values that are literally zero, so `helm install`,
`helm upgrade`, and `helm template` fail before anything reaches the cluster.
It does not evaluate the parsed duration; Flow does that at startup (see
below). The location names `deployment.yaml` because the Deployment's checksum
annotation renders the ConfigMap first:

```text
Error: execution error at (nico-flow/templates/deployment.yaml:...): flowConfig.inventoryRunFrequency must be a Go duration string with a unit, such as 30s, 1m, or 1h30m; got "30"
Error: execution error at (nico-flow/templates/deployment.yaml:...): flowConfig.leakDetectionInterval must be greater than zero; got "0s"
```

Flow validates the parsed value at startup and exits if it is unusable, which
also covers a file that bypasses the chart. A value that Go cannot parse, such
as a bare number or one beyond the `time.Duration` range (about `2562047h`),
fails with `Invalid configuration file /etc/flow/flowconfig.yaml: ...`. A value
that parses to zero, including a fraction below `1ns` such as
`0.0000000001s`, fails with `invalid inventory sync interval: interval must be
positive, got 0s` (or `invalid leak detection interval: ...`). The pod logs the
error and restarts until the value is corrected.

### Booleans

`disableInventory` and `disableLeakDetection` must be YAML booleans (`true` or
`false`). Strings are rejected at render time, including `--set-string` values
and `--set flowConfig.disableInventory=yes` (Helm passes `yes` as a string). In
a values file, Helm's YAML 1.1 parser reads an unquoted `yes` as `true`, so
prefer `true` and `false` there. A key that is omitted, set to `null`, or
removed with `--set flowConfig.disableInventory=null` takes the chart default.

```text
Error: execution error at (nico-flow/templates/deployment.yaml:...): flowConfig.disableInventory must be a boolean (true or false); got "true"
```

Override values on the existing release, for example. Use
`--reset-then-reuse-values` (Helm 3.14 or newer) rather than `--reuse-values`,
which would also reuse the previous chart's defaults and drop any value the
newer chart added. On Helm 4, add `--force-conflicts` when the chart version
changes, because objects created outside Helm (the `flow` Namespace, and
Certificates pre-applied by `setup.sh`) otherwise reject the new chart label:

```bash
helm upgrade flow ./helm/nico-flow \
  --namespace flow \
  --reset-then-reuse-values \
  --set flowConfig.leakDetectionInterval=5m \
  --set flowConfig.disableInventory=true
```

On Helm 4, add `--force-conflicts` after `--reset-then-reuse-values` when the
chart version changes.

Confirm the rendered file after the rollout:

```bash
kubectl get configmap flow-config-files -n flow -o jsonpath='{.data.flowconfig\.yaml}'
```

## Upgrading from 0.2.x

In chart 0.2.x, `flowConfig` was an optional raw string holding the whole file,
and the ConfigMap was only created when it was set. From 0.3.0, `flowConfig` is
a structured map with the keys above, and the ConfigMap is always rendered. A
release that never set `flowConfig` upgrades without changes: an absent block
or the 0.2.x empty-string default renders the chart defaults, so the upgrade
works with `--reset-then-reuse-values` and with `--reuse-values`. A non-empty
raw-string `flowConfig` fails at render time with `flowConfig must be a map of
settings ...; see the nico-flow README section "Upgrading from 0.2.x"`. Convert
an existing override before upgrading:

```yaml
# 0.2.x
flowConfig: |
  leak_detection_interval: 5m
  disable_inventory: true

# 0.3.0
flowConfig:
  leakDetectionInterval: 5m
  disableInventory: true
```

## Testing

```bash
helm lint helm/nico-flow
helm unittest helm/nico-flow
```
